I want to easily be able to document when I do things during the day. When I wake up and go to sleep. When I exercise, what I do, and how it feels. When I meditate. when and what I eat. etc.

hopefully this will provide insight into the kinds of activies that are good for me, and the kind that aren't.

Its kind of like an uber journal.
